# SimplyTrainingApp

Good day to everyone,

Here you can find a link to the github repository with the solution of the task. Please read the short README.md file.

For second criterion is concerned, I decided to show the frontend in React, which consumes Web API.

There are 3 folders:
-C# code server part
-SQL script for seeding the initial data
-React part used for frontend

In order for the application to work, it is necessary to run a server application, as well as a client application. The server is started from the visual studio, and the client from the command line from the path where is located, from the terminal should type command npm start.
